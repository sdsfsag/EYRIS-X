# EYRIS-X
A Palantir copy (prototype)

### Please keep in mind that this is just a prototype; the program will get even more awesome, but it all takes time. It's meant to be comparable to Palantir (maybe even better), but for now, it's just a testing phase!

## Firefox required!

# How to start
**cd EYRIS-X v2**
**python -m venv .venv**
**.venv\Scripts\activate**
**pip install -r requirements.txt**
**uvicorn app:app --reload**
